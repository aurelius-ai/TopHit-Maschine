#The Top Hit Machine
I am currently working with machine learning and I came up with the idea:
>“Develop a machine which can tell if a title will become a "top 10 tile" or not”

Let's start my experiment!
We collect about 400 Top 10 Titles and throw them into a database.
Can we draw any comparisons?

1. Do the songs often have chords that also occur in the other songs?
2. Do the songs have any similarities?
3. Are there often tones that have a certain consistency?
4. A certain clock frequency?


Then we could throw a new title into the machine and then say to what percentage the title is a top 10 hit or not.
You could also continue to spin and watch why people listen to certain genres of music.
